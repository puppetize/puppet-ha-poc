{"name":"Puppet HA: Proof-of-Concept","tagline":"Building a highly-available & load-balancing Puppet infrastructure - Vagrant example scenario","body":"Simply `vagrant up` and wait.  Puppet clients `agent*` will be provisioned\r\nlast.  If all goes well, then they will run `puppet agent -t` once against\r\nany master via DNS round-robin and then once against each available master,\r\nindividually.  All three runs should succeed.\r\n\r\nNow you can start shutting down instances of **gluster**, **puppet** or\r\n**puppetdb**.  Reinstallation of instances should also work for **agent**,\r\n**puppet** and **puppetdb**.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have the time or a powerful enough development machine, have\r\na look at the file [output.txt](output.txt).  It contains the output of the\r\nshell provisioner for a successful run of `vagrant up | egrep 'Machine booted\r\nand ready|Running provisioner|^[+]'`.\r\n\r\nWhat's Missing\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nWe still need to work on a way to add/remove/reinstall **gluster** nodes\r\nand a high-availability/load-balancing setup for PostgreSQL (master plus\r\nhot-standby).  The latter task is tracked in\r\n[issue #1](https://github.com/puppetize/puppet-ha-poc/issues/1).\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\n\r\n* Vagrant (tested with 1.3.1)\r\n* VirtualBox (tested with 4.2)\r\n","google":"UA-40430933-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
